# Overview

Hi, My name is Jarvis Kwong.

I'm trying to create computer systems and applications to help the world to become a better place.

This is a Quizz app that I made in Java language.

I create the app to help people to quiz themselves. I found that it helps people to study and memorize the subject better. 

The link below is a walkthrough of the code.
